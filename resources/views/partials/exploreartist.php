    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-600 mb-8 pt-12">IT TAKES INNOVATION</h2>
    <p class="text-lg md:text-xl mb-6">
        Art is not about fame, wealth, or status—it is about expression. From the brushstrokes of an Italian Renaissance master to the street murals of an unknown painter in Brazil, artistry transcends geography, culture, and time. Anyone can be an artist, and everyone has a unique story to tell through their creativity. Art is a universal language that speaks to the soul, evoking emotions, sparking imagination, preserving the beauty of human experiences. It bridges gaps between different cultures and generations, allowing us to see the world through perspectives we may have never considered before. Whether through painting, sculpture, music, literature, or dance, art has the power to inspire and transform lives. You do not need formal training or expensive materials to create something meaningful. The greatest artists in history were not born with perfected skills; they developed their craft through dedication, curiosity, and a desire to communicate their emotions. True artistry lies in perseverance—the act of refining your vision, taking risks, and daring to share your creativity with the world. There is no right or wrong way to be an artist. Whether you are sixteen or sixty, living in a quiet village or a bustling city, your artistic voice matters. Art is not reserved for the privileged or the famous; it belongs to anyone willing to create, experiment, and express themselves freely. It does not require recognition to be valuable—art has the power to move people whether seen by millions or just a handful. Every masterpiece begins as a simple idea, a fleeting spark of inspiration. The world is filled with artists who started with nothing but passion—turning ordinary moments into extraordinary works of art. Your creative journey is uniquely yours, shaped by your experiences, emotions, and imagination. So, the question is not "Are you an artist?" but rather: "What story will you tell?" Pick up the brush, the pen, the camera, the instrument, or whatever medium calls to you—your masterpiece begins now.

    <!-- Second Section Title & Paragraph -->
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-600 mb-8 pt-12">EVERYONE IS AN ARTIST</h2>
    <p class="text-lg md:text-xl mb-6">
        Everyone is an artist in their own way, whether they realize it or not. Art is not confined to galleries or concert halls—it exists in the way we arrange our spaces, tell stories, cook meals, or capture moments in a photograph. Creativity is woven into everyday life, shaping how we see and interact with the world. The ability to express, to innovate, and to transform ideas into something tangible is not reserved for the few—it belongs to everyone. You do not need a title or an audience to be an artist; you only need the courage to create.
